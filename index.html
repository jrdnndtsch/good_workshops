				<p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday April 26, 2018</p>
				<p><strong>Time:</strong> 6pm - 9pm</p>
				<p><strong>Location:</strong> Canada Learning Code Offices, 129 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5V 2L3, Fifth Floor</p>
				<p>** This is an accessible learning space. Please contact us with any questions you may have about navigating the space. **</p>
				<p>This Shopify app development workshop is targeted at developers who are looking to jump into app development for e-commerce projects. As part of this workshop, we will introduce you to a variety of resources to support your development with Shopify.</p>
				<p>Using Ruby on Rails as a back-end framework, this workshop begins by building a base Shopify Private Application to integrate with one of your own development stores. You'll leave this workshop with a set of steps to start up any new app development project, with a greater understanding of how clients or your own shops could be served by a private app.</p>
